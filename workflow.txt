Project Overview
Goal: Build a web app where users can label images interactively. The app uses active learning to intelligently select regions (e.g., objects, edges) that need labeling, reducing the total effort required.

Key Features:
1. Upload and preprocess images.
2. Highlight regions where the model is uncertain (using scikit-activeml).
3. Let users label these regions via clicks.
4. Retrain the model incrementally and visualize improvements.
5. Track labeled data and model performance in real time.

Strategy: Deep Pool-Based Active Learning

Libraries Used:
- scikit-activeml: perform pool-based active learning
- scikit-image: image classification algorithm
- 

Dataset used:
